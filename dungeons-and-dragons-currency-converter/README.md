## Technical Details

### D&D 5e Currency Exchange Rates

The script uses the standard D&D 5e currency exchange rates:

| Currency | Abbreviation | Value in Gold Pieces |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Platinum | pp           | 10 gp                |
| Gold     | gp           | 1 gp                 |
| Electrum | ep           | 0.5 gp               |
| Silver   | sp           | 0.1 gp               |
| Copper   | cp           | 0.01 gp              |

### Conversion Logic

The conversion process follows these steps:

1. Convert the input amount from the source currency to gold pieces (the base currency)
2. Convert from gold pieces to the target currency
3. Format the result with appropriate decimal places
4. If converting to a lower value currency, calculate the optimal breakdown

### Code Structure

The userscript is structured as follows:

- **UserScript Metadata**: Defines script properties for userscript managers
- **SVG Icons**: Font Awesome icons for the UI elements
- **Currency Rates**: Object defining the D&D 5e currency values
- **CSS Styles**: Styling for the converter widget and toggle button
- **DOM Elements**: Creation of the toggle button and converter widget
- **Event Listeners**: Handling user interactions
- **Conversion Functions**: Logic for currency conversion and breakdown

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following sections:

- **Color Scheme**: Change the colors in the CSS styles section (look for `#8B0000` and related colors)
- **Position**: Adjust the `bottom` and `right` properties in the CSS for `#dnd-toggle-btn` and `#dnd-currency-converter`
- **Size**: Modify the `width` property of `#dnd-currency-converter` to change the widget size

## Troubleshooting

- **Widget Not Appearing**: Make sure your userscript manager is enabled for the current website
- **Conversion Not Working**: Check that you've entered a valid number in the Amount field
- **Styling Issues**: Some websites with aggressive CSS might affect the widget styling; try adjusting the z-index values in the CSS
