## What is the difference between a Userscript and a Browser Extension?

Userscripts and browser extensions both enhance your browsing experience but differ in scope and implementation.
Userscripts are simple JavaScript files that run on specific web pages. They're installed through managers like Tampermonkey and are mainly limited to manipulating page content. Theyâ€™re easy to create but have limited permissions.

Browser extensions, on the other hand, are comprehensive packages installed through browser stores. They can modify the browser UI, create popups, access powerful APIs, and run background processes. Extensions undergo vendor review and offer much deeper integration with the browser.

TLDR;
- Use userscripts for quick, targeted page tweaks.
- Use browser extensions for complex, browser-wide functionality.

### Quick Comparisons:

| Feature | Userscript | Browser Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Per website | Full browser |
| Install Method | Through userscript manager | Browser extension store |
| APIs Available | Limited (DOM + GM_* APIs) | Full browser APIs |
| UI Capabilities | Minimal (no popup/menu) | Full UI (popup, options, etc.) |
| Complexity | Simple | Can be complex/multi-file |

## What are Userscript Managers?

Userscript managers are browser extensions that allow you to:

- Install and manage userscripts
- Run custom JavaScript code on specific websites
- Enhance website functionality
- Automate browser tasks
- Modify website appearance and behavior

Popular userscript managers include Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey (Firefox's original), and Violentmonkey (open-source alternative).
